The resulting code, which is not highly optimized, [is ~23kb][dl], or [Brotli][]
compressed down to ~9kb.

## Contributing

This project uses [`just`][] to run commands the same way as the CI:

- `cargo just init` to install dependencies needed by the rest of the commands.
- `cargo just check` to check formatting and lints.
- `cargo just test` to run tests.
- `cargo just serve` to preview the app, re-building on changes.
- `cargo just coverage` to generate and preview code coverage.

[`just`]: https://crates.io/crates/just

For a full list of commands, see the [`Justfile`](./Justfile).

> TIP: To speedup tools and use prebuilt binaries, [install `cargo-binstall`][].
